    "## About Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas\n",
    "Right now you're looking at a Jupyter Notebook: an interactive, browser based programming environment. You can use these notebooks to program in R, Julia or Python - as you'll be doing later on. Read more about Jupyter Notebook in the [Jupyter Notebook Quick Start Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). \n",
    "  \n",
    "To analyse up our data, we'll be using Python and Pandas. Pandas is an open-source Python library - basically an extra toolkit to go with Python - that is designed for data analysis. Pandas is flexible, easy to use and has lots of useful functions built right in. Read more about Pandas and its features in [the Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). That Pandas functions in ways similar to both spreadsheets and SQL databases (though the latter won't be discussed in this course), makes it beginner friendly. :)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook shortcuts**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Within Jupyter Notebooks, there are some shortcuts you can use. If you'll be using more notebooks for your data analysis in the future, you'll remember these shortcuts soon enough. :) \n",
    "\n",
    "* `esc` will take you into command mode\n",
    "* `a` will insert cell above\n",
    "* `b` will insert cell below\n",
    "* `shift then tab` will show you the documentation for your code\n",
    "* `shift and enter` will run your cell\n",
    "* ` d d` will delete a cell\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **dataframe**: dataframe is Pandas speak for a table with a labeled y-axis, also known as an index. (The index usually starts at 0.)\n",
    "* **series**: a series is a list, a series can be made of a single column within a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, a little more about Jupyter Notebooks. Every notebooks is made out of cells. A cell can either contain Markdown text - like this one - or code. In the latter you can execute your code. To see what that means, type the following command in the next cell `print(\"hello world\")`."
